# AWS Job Search Application Security Checklist

This checklist outlines security considerations for the AWS Job Search Application deployment. Use this document to ensure your deployment meets security best practices.

## Infrastructure Security

### VPC Configuration
- [ ] VPC isolated with appropriate CIDR blocks
- [ ] Public subnets used only for load balancers and bastion hosts
- [ ] Private subnets used for application servers and databases
- [ ] Network ACLs configured to restrict traffic

### Security Groups
- [ ] Security groups follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] SSH access restricted to specific IP addresses
- [ ] Database access restricted to application servers
- [ ] Internal services not exposed to public internet

### IAM Configuration
- [ ] IAM roles use least privilege permissions
- [ ] IAM instance profiles configured for EC2 instances
- [ ] No IAM user access keys stored on servers
- [ ] Regular rotation of access keys and credentials

## Application Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] User authentication implemented with secure password storage
- [ ] Password policies enforce complexity requirements
- [ ] JWT or session tokens secured and verified
- [ ] Role-based access controls implemented
- [ ] API endpoints protected against unauthorized access

### Data Protection
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all web traffic
- [ ] SSL certificates managed through AWS Certificate Manager
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest in RDS/DynamoDB
- [ ] Personal identifiable information (PII) properly protected
- [ ] Database connection strings and credentials not hardcoded

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] Protection against SQL injection attacks
- [ ] Protection against XSS attacks
- [ ] API rate limiting implemented

## Operational Security

### Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] CloudWatch logging configured for application logs
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms set for suspicious activities
- [ ] CloudTrail enabled for API activity logging
- [ ] Log retention policies defined and implemented
- [ ] Automated alerting for security events

### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Regular database backups configured
- [ ] Backup retention policies defined
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Data restore process verified

### Patching & Updates
- [ ] Regular OS patching schedule established

- [ ] Security vulnerabilities addressed promptly
- [ ] Immutable infrastructure approach where possible

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy
