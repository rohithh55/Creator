  - S3 backups of critical application data
  - Test restoration process regularly

- [ ] **Data Lifecycle Management**
  - Define data retention policies
  - Implement archiving for older data
  - Set up automated cleanup processes

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting

- [ ] **CloudWatch Configuration**
  - Set up custom dashboards for application metrics
  - Configure appropriate alarms for system health
  - Implement log aggregation and analysis

- [ ] **Application Performance Monitoring**

- **Reserved Instances**: For predictable base load
- **Spot Instances**: For non-critical background processing

### Storage Optimization

- **S3 Storage Classes**: Transition to lower-cost storage for older data
- **RDS Storage**: Monitor and adjust based on actual usage
- **EBS Volumes**: Use appropriate volume types for workload

### Operational Efficiency

- **CloudWatch Alarms**: For unusual spending patterns
- **Cost Explorer**: Regular review of spending trends
